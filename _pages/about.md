I am a Doctoral Research Fellow at [ARENA Centre for European Studies](https://www.sv.uio.no/arena/english/) of the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/). My research focuses on the interaction between the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and the European Commission regarding violations of the rule of law and core EU membership principles. Specifically, I analyze the EU’s inconsistent response to rule of law breaches in Hungary and Poland since 2010, as part of the ENROL project.

My broader interests include comparative political institutions, causal inference, and methodological innovation. My research focuses on institutional hierarchy and decision-making processes, with established expertise in judicial politics and European integration. I develop novel measurement strategies and statistical frameworks that address conceptual limitations in existing research and enable more precise analysis of institutional behavior. A central theme in my work is how institutional settings and human psyhcological packages shape political outcomes across different contexts.

In data science, I connect empirical research on political institutions with advanced data collection and processing techniques. I explore how variations in institutional effectiveness are affected by factors like hierarchical relationships, legal preferences, and decision-making structures. My technical expertise spans R and Python programming, computational text analysis, and custom software development for political research.

<!-- 
I am soon to gradute from a Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters in *European Politics and Society* at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/humanities/graduate-school). I’m also a contributing author and founding member of the [*European Waves*](https://www.europeanwaves.com/eps-spotlight/) blog. My research interests comprise the evolutionary trajectories of political systems, democratic performance, and data science.

Within Comparative Politics, I investigate the evolutionary trajectories of political systems and their specific institutions. By leveraging insights from political theory, I develop empirically testable research designs that allow for more scientific comparisons across time and space. One fundamental question that animates my research relates to the patterns that foster and foreclose the pathways of institutional change. That is, how do sets of institutional arrangements vary in their performance across democratic polities?

As for data science, I aim to build breaches between empirical research on democracy and novel data collection and processing techniques. Particularly, I explore the variation in the performance of democratic institutions derived from variables such as kinship, impersonal trust, or degree of market integration.

Lastly, I am a regular commentator on European and International Affairs for venues including European Waves, and [the Loop: ECPR](https://theloop.ecpr.eu/) and a recurring guest lecturer at [*the Tecnológico de Monterrey*](https://tec.mx/en/about-us) in Mexico.
